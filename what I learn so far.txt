Section 3: TensorFlow.js Core Concepts
	19. Memory Mnagement in TensorFlow.js
		- Tensors stored in WebGL, operations happen in WebGL
		- JS has garbage collection but WebGL backend has no garbage collection
		- not strictly necessary without WebGL backend
 			+ "tf.tidy(functionName)" will free up memory after function executed and result ouput to console
			+ "tf.memory()" check memory usage

Section 4: Data Preparation with TensorFlow.js
	23. Linear Regression
		- search for free dataset on "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets"
	24. Reading data from CSV
		- need to load the CSV file through http webserver
		- "npm install http-server -g" to set up a simple http server
	28. Splitting into Training and Testing data
		- shuffle before splitting into sets
		- avoids patterns in order of data
		-"tf.util.shuffle(arrayName)" to shuffle the whole array
		- make sure the array length is even when splitting, otherwise may get error
